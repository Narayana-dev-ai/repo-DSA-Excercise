"""
Given an integer array X[] of size n, write a program to find all the leaders in the array X[]. An element is a leader if it is strictly greater than all the elements to its right side.
    The last element of an array is a leader by default.
    The largest element of an array is also a leader by default.
    Suppose all the array elements are unique.
    Ordering in the output doesnâ€™t matter.
Examples::

Input:
    X[] = [16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2]
Output: [17, 5, 2]

Explanation:&nbsp;Element 2 is the rightmost element, so it is a leader by default. 17 and 5 are also leader elements because they are greater than all the elements on their right side.
