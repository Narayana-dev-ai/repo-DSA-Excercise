Graphs
A Graph is a non-linear data structure that consists of vertices (nodes) and edges.

A vertex, also called a node, is a point or an object in the Graph, and an edge is used to connect two vertices with each other.

Graphs are non-linear because the data structure allows us to have different paths to get from one vertex to another, unlike with linear data structures like Arrays or Linked Lists.

Graphs are used to represent and solve problems where the data consists of objects and relationships between them, such as:

    Social Networks: Each person is a vertex, and relationships (like friendships) are the edges. Algorithms can suggest potential friends.
    Maps and Navigation: Locations, like a town or bus stops, are stored as vertices, and roads are stored as edges. Algorithms can find the shortest route between two locations when stored as a Graph.
    Internet: Can be represented as a Graph, with web pages as vertices and hyperlinks as edges.
    Biology: Graphs can model systems like neural networks or the spread of diseases.

A weighted Graph is a Graph where the edges have values. The weight value of an edge can represent things like distance, capacity, time, or probability.

A connected Graph is when all the vertices are connected through edges somehow. A Graph that is not connected, is a Graph with isolated (disjoint) subgraphs, or single isolated vertices.

A directed Graph, also known as a digraph, is when the edges between the vertex pairs have a direction. The direction of an edge can represent things like hierarchy or flow.
